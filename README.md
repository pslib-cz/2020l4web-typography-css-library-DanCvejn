## Dependecies

## Implementation
Just download css file and link it to your html.
```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./*/typography.css">
```
"*" = folder where you have css files.

If you have it in the same folder as the html file then use this: 
```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./typography.css"> 
```
Next download these two **fonts**:
* [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather?query=mer)
    - Just regular will be enough
* [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans?query=work)
    - Just regular and bold
    
Put fonts in the folder that is called *font* and this folder has to be in the same folder as the css file.
